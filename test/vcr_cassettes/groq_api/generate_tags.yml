        the following post content and extract interest tags in two categories: niche
        and general.\n\n# Requirements\n- Generate two sets of tags:\n  1. **Niche
        Tags (3-5 tags):** Capture the specific subject matter or context of the post.\n  2.
        **General Tags (7-10 tags):** Represent broad topics with universal appeal.\n-
        Both sets must include at least one tag that explicitly classifies the domain
        of the content.\n- **Do not repeat tags:** Ensure that no tag appears in both
        the niche and general categories.\n- Tags should be **generic, engaging, and
        interesting**—optimized for user curiosity and discoverability.\n- All tags
        must be **lemmatized** (reduced to their base form).\n\n# Compound Topics\n-
        If a compound topic exists (e.g., \"ruby on rails\"), include:\n  - The full
        topic (e.g., \"ruby on rails\").\n  - Key components if they are relevant
        standalone interests (e.g., \"ruby\").\n- Standalone components should be
        weighted at 90% of the compound tag''s weight, rounded to the nearest multiple
        of 5.\n\n# Tag Format\n- Use **only lowercase alphanumeric characters and
        spaces** (no punctuation, special symbols, dashes, or underscores).\n- Prefer
        **single-word tags** unless two-word tags add clarity.\n\n# Weighting System\n-
        Assign a weight from **1 to 100**:\n  - **Niche tags:** 85-100 (most specific
        and targeted).\n  - **General tags:** 60-85 (broad and widely relevant).\n\n#
        Output Format\n- Return a valid JSON object:\n  {\n    \"tags\": {\n      \"niche\":
        {\n        \"tag1\": weight1,\n        \"tag2\": weight2,\n        ...\n      },\n      \"general\":

        content and extract interest tags into two categories: niche and general.
        Let me start by understanding the requirements thoroughly.\n\nFirst, the post
        is about the top 5 Ruby on Rails gems for e-commerce development. It lists
        Spree, Solidus, Devise, Pundit, and Stripe, along with some bonus gems. So,
        the main subject is Ruby on Rails gems, specifically for e-commerce.\n\nFor
        the niche tags, I should capture the specific subject matter. The obvious
        ones are \"ruby on rails\" and \"ecommerce\". Since the post focuses on gems,
        \"gems\" is another niche tag. Also, \"web development\" is a specific area
        within Rails. That gives me four niche tags, but I can add one more. Maybe
        \"rails gems\" as a compound tag, but I think \"gems\" is sufficient. Wait,
        the compound topic rule says if it''s like \"ruby on rails\", include the
        full topic and key components. So, \"ruby on rails\" is a compound, and \"ruby\"
        and \"rails\" as standalone. But since the post is about Rails gems, maybe
        \"ruby on rails\" is the compound, and \"rails\" as a standalone. However,
        the example in the requirements uses \"ruby on rails\" as a single tag, so
        I''ll include that as a niche tag.\n\nNow, for the general tags, I need broader
        topics. The post is about web development, so that''s a general tag. E-commerce
        is also a general tag. It involves programming, software development, and
        technology. The tools mentioned like Stripe and Devise relate to payment processing
        and user authentication. Also, scalability and performance are important aspects.
        Product management and online shopping are part of e-commerce. So, I can include
        tags like \"web development\", \"programming\", \"software development\",
        \"technology\", \"payment processing\", \"user authentication\", \"scalability\",
        \"product management\", and \"online shopping\".\n\nI need to ensure that
        no tags are repeated between niche and general. So, \"ruby on rails\" and
        \"ecommerce\" are in niche, so they shouldn''t be in general. Wait, in the
        example response, \"ecommerce\" is in both, but the user said not to repeat.
        Hmm, maybe I should adjust. Let me check the example again. Oh, in the example,
        \"ecommerce\" is in both, but the user''s instruction says not to repeat.
        So, perhaps I should avoid that. Maybe in the general tags, instead of \"ecommerce\",
        use a broader term like \"online shopping\".\n\nWait, the example response
        has \"ecommerce\" in both, but the user''s instruction says not to repeat.
        So, perhaps the example is incorrect, or maybe I''m misunderstanding. Let
        me re-read the requirements. It says, \"Do not repeat tags: Ensure that no
        tag appears in both the niche and general categories.\" So, I must avoid repetition.
        Therefore, in the general tags, I shouldn''t include \"ecommerce\" if it''s
        already in niche. So, I''ll replace it with \"online shopping\".\n\nNow, assigning
        weights. Niche tags should be 85-100. General tags 60-85. For niche, \"ruby
        on rails\" is the most specific, so 100. \"Ecommerce\" is also very specific,
        95. \"Gems\" is specific to Rails, 90. \"Web development\" is a bit broader
        but still niche, 85.\n\nFor general tags, \"web development\" is 85, but wait,
        I already used it in niche. Oh, no, I can''t. So, I need to find other general
        tags. Let me list them again without \"web development\". So, \"programming\"
        is 80, \"software development\" 75, \"technology\" 70, \"payment processing\"
        65, \"user authentication\" 65, \"scalability\" 65, \"product management\"
        65, and \"online shopping\" 65.\n\nWait, but the example includes \"web development\"
        in both, which I think is a mistake. So, I''ll make sure not to repeat any
        tags. Therefore, my general tags will be \"programming\", \"software development\",
        \"technology\", \"payment processing\", \"user authentication\", \"scalability\",
        \"product management\", and \"online shopping\".\n\nNow, checking the compound
        topics. \"Ruby on rails\" is a compound, so I include it as a niche tag. Its
        components \"ruby\" and \"rails\" could be standalone, but since the focus
        is on Rails, maybe \"rails\" is sufficient as a niche tag. But in the example,
        they included \"ruby\" as a general tag. So, perhaps I should include \"ruby\"
        in general. Wait, but \"ruby on rails\" is a niche tag, so \"ruby\" could
        be a general tag. Let me think. The post is about Rails gems, so \"ruby\"
        is the language, which is a general tag. So, I''ll include \"ruby\" in general
        tags with a weight of 70.\n\nSimilarly, \"stripe\" is a specific gem, but
        it''s part of the general tags as \"payment processing\". So, I think I''ve
        covered that.\n\nNow, putting it all together. Niche tags: \"ruby on rails\",
        \"ecommerce\", \"gems\", \"web development\". General tags: \"programming\",
        \"software development\", \"technology\", \"payment processing\", \"user authentication\",
        \"scalability\", \"product management\", \"online shopping\", \"ruby\".\n\nWait,
        but \"ruby\" is part of \"ruby on rails\", so as a compound, I should include
        \"ruby\" as a standalone in general. So, I''ll add \"ruby\" to general tags.\n\nLet
        me check the counts. Niche: 4 tags, which is within 3-5. General: 9 tags,
        which is within 7-10. No overlaps except \"ruby on rails\" and \"ruby\", but
        they are in different categories, so that''s okay.\n\nAssigning weights: Niche
        tags are 100, 95, 90, 85. General tags: 80, 75, 70, 65, etc.\n\nI think that''s
        a solid approach. Now, I''ll structure the JSON accordingly.\n"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"queue_time":0.048316858,"prompt_tokens":668,"prompt_time":0.040268851,"completion_tokens":1426,"completion_time":5.185454545,"total_tokens":2094,"total_time":5.225723396},"system_fingerprint":"fp_2834edf0f4","x_groq":{"id":"req_01jpz9jr11ep1ak8brh67w5w6e"}}
